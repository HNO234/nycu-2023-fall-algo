Given an undirected connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ undirected edges.
The vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$. 
Each edge has a color $c_i$ and a weight $w_i$.
There are $k$ possible colors, which are numbered from $1$ to $k$.
Each color is associated with a weight $p_i$.

Your objective is to choose a subset of edges while ensuring the graph remains connected.
The \textit{cost} of this chosen subset is calculated as the sum of the $w_i$ values of all selected edges.
However, if any edge of a particular color $j$ is included in the subset, 
an additional cost of $p_j$ is added specifically for that color $j$.
Note that $p_j$ is added to the cost at most once for any subset of edges.

Your goal is to determine the minimum cost required to maintain the connectivity of the graph.
