The first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$.
The second line of input contains $n$ space-separated integers $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_k$.
Each of the following $m$ lines contains four integers $u_i$, $v_i$, $w_i$ and $c_i$, where the $i$-th line denotes that there is an undirected edge from vertex $u_i$ to $v_i$ in the graph.
