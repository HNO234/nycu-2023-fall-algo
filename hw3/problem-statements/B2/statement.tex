Given an empty array, a fixed positive integer $k$ and $q$ queries to be performed on the array. Each query belongs to one of the following two types:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $1\ x_i$ — Append $x_i$ to the end of the array.
    \item $2$ — Find the $k$-th order statistic of the numbers from the array and
    remove \textbf{one copy} of it. If there are fewer than $k$ elements in the array,
    nothing is done to the array.
\end{enumerate}
Can you answer all these queries?
