Given two \textbf{increasing} arrays, $a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n$ and $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$,
we create an ``increasing matrix" $A$ with dimensions $n \times m$,
where the $j$-th element of the $i$-th row can be determined as $A_{i,j} = a_i^2 + a_ib_j + b_j^2$.
The term ``increasing matrix" is used because the elements in each row are arranged in ascending order. 

Your task is to find the $k$ smallest elements in the matrix $A$.
To avoid large amount of output, you have to output the bitwise XOR of the $k$ smallest elements.
