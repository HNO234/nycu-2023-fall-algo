You are given a graph of $n$ verticies, where the vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$.
There are no edges between the vertices initially.

$q$ queries are given. Each query belongs to one of the following three types:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $1\ u_i\ v_i$ — Add an \textbf{undirected} edge between vertex $u_i$ and $v_i$.
    \item $2\ u_i$ — Find the number of verticies in the same connected component as $u_i$.
\end{enumerate}
Can you answer all these queries?
