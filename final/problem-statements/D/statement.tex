A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.
You are given a tree of $n$ vertices, where the vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$.
Each vertex is associated with a weight $a_i$.

An independent set within a graph is a collection of vertices where none are directly connected.
In other words, it's a set $S$ of vertices where no two vertices in $S$ share an edge.
The \textit{value} of an independent set refers to the sum of the $a_i$ values associated with the vertices it contains.
The task is to determine the maximum achievable \textit{value} of an independent set within the provided tree.
