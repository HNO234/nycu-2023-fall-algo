The first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $type$.
$type$ denotes the type of questions: $type = 1$ denotes the first type while $type = 2$ denotes the second type.
Each of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $u_i$, $v_i$ and $w_i$, where the $i$-th line denotes that there is an undirected edge from vertex $u_i$ to $v_i$ in the graph.
