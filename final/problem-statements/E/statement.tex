You are given an undirected graph containing $n$ vertices and $m$ undirected edges, where the vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$. Every edge in this graph is associated with a weight $w_i$.

A shortest path from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ is a path between $u$ and $v$ where no other paths are shorter than it.
It is important to note that there can be multiple shortest paths within a graph.
For instance, consider a three-node undirected graph with weighted edges: $(1, 2)$ with a weight of $1$, $(2, 3)$ with a weight of $1$, and $(1, 3)$ with a weight of $2$.
In this case, there are two shortest paths from vertex $1$ to vertex $3$: $1 \to 2 \to 3$ and $1 \to 3$.

This problem comprises two types of questions falling into the following categories:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the length of the shortest path from vertex $1$ to vertex $2$.
    \item Calculate the count of shortest paths from vertex $1$ to vertex $2$.
    Output the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the edges weights are always positive in this problem.
