You have been provided with $n$ points and $n$ intervals on the real number line. The $i$-th point is represented by the coordinate $x_i$, while the $i$-th interval is denoted as $[l_i, r_i]$ (inclusive).

We define that a point $i$ is considered to be covered by an interval $j$ if and only if the condition $l_j \leq x_i \leq r_j$ is satisfied. Your task is to determine whether it is feasible to pair each interval with exactly one point covered by that interval, ensuring that no point is used more than once.
