In the first line, output the minimum cost required to divide the rod into $n$ pieces.

In the second line, provide a sequence of $n - 1$ integers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}$. These integers represent the order in which the cuts should be made. To clarify, when outputting $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}$, you will begin by making the first cut at the $a_1$-th marked point and continue with subsequent cuts, all the way to the $a_{n-1}$-th marked point.

To achieve a correct solution, it is essential that $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ forms a permutation of $1, 2, \ldots, n-1$, demonstrating a method to make these cuts that minimizes the cost.
