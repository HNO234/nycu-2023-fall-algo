You are presented with a rod of length $x_n$ that has $n$ marked points. The distance between the beginning of the rod and the $i$-th marked point is denoted as $x_i$.

\end{figure}

Your objective is to divide the rod into $n$ pieces using $n-1$ cuts. In each cut, you choose an unselected marked point $x_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - 1$) and make the cut at that point. As a result, the rod containing that marked point is split into two separate pieces. The cost associated with this operation is equal to the difference in length between the two resulting rods.

Your task is to determine the minimum cost required to break the rod into $n$ pieces.
You also have to show a way to perform the cuts.
