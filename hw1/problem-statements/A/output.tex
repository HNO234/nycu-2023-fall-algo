Output the maximum subarray sum $s$ in the first line.
Then in the second line, output two positive integers $l, r$, denoting the subarray itself.
If there are multiple subarrays with the maximum sum, you can output any of them.

Specifically, your output would be considered correct if it satisfies all the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$
    \item $\sum_{i = l}^{r} a_i = s$
    \item $s$ is the maximum among all possible subarrays.
\end{itemize}
