You are provided with two integer arrays, $a$ and $b$, both of length $n$.
Your objective is to rearrange the elements within array $b$ to maximize the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_ib_i$.
This sum represents the total of products obtained by pairing elements from $a$ and $b$ with the same indices.
Output the maximum attainable sum.
