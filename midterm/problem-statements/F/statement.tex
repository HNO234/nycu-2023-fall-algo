As the chief judge of a local competition,
you oversee $n$ teams. The $i$-th team has a designated strength $a_i$.

The competition consists of $n - 1$ games, pitting two remaining teams against each other in each round.
The team with the lower strength value loses and is eliminated.
However, post each game, the strength of the winning team decreases by a constant $k$.
After all $n - 1$ games, only one team remainsâ€”the champion.

It's crucial to note that a team's strength can be positive, negative, or zero after several rounds.
Additionally, in cases where two teams possess equal strength at the start of a game, 
you can decide either team to be the winner.

The objective is to determine if it is possible for each team to be the champion, given the flexibility to decide which two teams to play in each game.
