Given an array of $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ and $q$ queries to be performed on these integers. Each query belongs to one of the following two types:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $1\ idx_i\ v_i$ — Change $a_{idx_i}$ to $v_i$. That is, $a_{idx_i} := v_i$.
    \item $2\ l_i\ r_i$ — Find the maximum of the numbers $a_{l_i},a_{l_i+1},\ldots,a_{r_i}$.
    In other words, sort the numbers $a_{l_i},a_{l_i+1},\ldots,a_{r_i}$ in ascending order and output the last element.
\end{enumerate}
Can you answer all these queries?
