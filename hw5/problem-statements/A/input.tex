The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$.
The second line of input contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.
Each of the following $m$ lines contains two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$, where the $i$-th line denotes that there is a directed edge from vertex $u_i$ to $v_i$ in the graph.
