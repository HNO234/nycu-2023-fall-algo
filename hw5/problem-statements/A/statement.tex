Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with $n$ vertices and $m$ directed edges,
where the vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$.
The $i$-th vertex has a weight $a_i$.

A path in a graph is a sequence of distinct verticies $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k$,
where $k \geq 1$ and each pair of adjacent vertices share an edge.
Find the maximum sum of weights among all paths in the given DAG.
