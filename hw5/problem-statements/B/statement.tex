You are given a graph of $n$ verticies, where the vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$.
Each vertex has a color of black or white.
There are no edges between the vertices initially.

$q$ queries are given. Each query belongs to one of the following three types:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $1\ u_i\ v_i$ — Add an \textbf{undirected} edge between vertex $u_i$ and $v_i$.
    \item $2\ u_i$ — Find the number of black verticies in the same connected component as $u_i$.
    \item $3\ u_i$ — Find the nearest distance of a black vertex from vertex $u_i$.
    The distance between two verticies is the smallest number of edges in a path between two vertices.
    If there are no black verticies reachable from vertex $u_i$, output $-1$. 
    \textbf{Note that the number of this type of query is limited to $100$ in this problem.}
\end{enumerate}
Can you answer all these queries?
