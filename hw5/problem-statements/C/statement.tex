Given a directed graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ directed edges,
where the vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

A cycle in a directed graph is a sequence of vertices $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k,v_1$,
where $k \geq 1$, only the first and last vertices are equal and each pair of adjacent vertices share an edge.
Define a vertex to be \textit{isolated} if it is not in any cycle.
Find the number of isolated verticies in the graph.
