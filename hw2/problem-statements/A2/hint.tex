Conduct a binary search for the desired answer within the range from $1$ to $10^{18}$.

In each iteration of the binary search, when the answer falls within the interval between $l$ and $r$, 
and $m$ is calculated as $m = \lfloor \frac{l+r}{2} \rfloor$, 
proceed to count the number of integers between $1$ and $m$ that satisfy the given condition.
Adjust the values of $l$ or $r$ based on whether or not this count is at least $k$.
