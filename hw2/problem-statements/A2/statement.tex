Given two positive integers $a$ and $b$, we create an ascending array of positive integers that are divisible by either $a$ or $b$, \textbf{but not both simultaneously}.

For example, if $a=2$ and $b=3$, the initial terms of the list would be: $2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, \ldots$.
Your task is to find the $k$-th term in this array.
